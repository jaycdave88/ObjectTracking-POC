# ObjectTracking-POC

> Object tracking proof of concept - I am going to build a application built on WPF with Visual Studios written in C# with OpenCV Lib to use my standard USB camera (laptop Camera) to record a video and add an object tracking with a set point (a line in the video) onces the tracked object crosses that virtual line an event wil fire off.
